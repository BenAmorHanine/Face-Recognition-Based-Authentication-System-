face detection: choice between MTCNN and Haar Cascade wich is real time. In our case, the user "logs" his face in order to get aithenticated so we dont really need real time authentication.
the usual is: using MTCNN for enrollment or registration as it is more occure so more secure, and use Real time verif like Haar Cacade or BlazeFce or YuNet as it is more ligntweight and especially faster.
the idea is to combine so we merge user experience (fast) and acuracy. and in this case , We'll split the system into:

âœ… 1. Enrollment Flow (High accuracy with MTCNN) for high-quality face alignment.
ðŸ”„ 2. Authentication Flow (Fast real-time with Haar Cascade) + MTCNN for alignment only.


==>>>Detector Selection Strategy
Scenario 1: Use only one detector for both enrollment and verification (e.g., MTCNN for all steps).
Scenario 2: Use different detectors (e.g., MTCNN for enrollment, Haar for verification).

Weâ€™ll implement Scenario 2 for optimal balance between accuracy and speed.
for the authentif we needed before it to set up: the face deection then the generation of the embedding, leter we use them for the enrollment and verif( you can read the doc of the 2 functions in order to understand)

dataset/
Raw Images: Store original user enrollment images (e.g., dataset/raw/users/alice/1.jpg).

Processed Data: Save cropped/aligned faces (e.g., dataset/processed/users/alice.jpg).

models/
Pre-trained Models: Host downloaded weights (e.g., models/pretrained/facenet_weights.h5).
Custom Models: Save models you train (e.g., models/custom/liveness_model.pth
BUTT:
1. Why You Donâ€™t Need models/ for Pre-Trained Models (Yet)
If you're only using existing libraries like:

MTCNN (via mtcnn package)

FaceNet (via deepface package)

Haar Cascades (via OpenCVâ€™s built-in XML files)

...these models are automatically handled by their respective libraries. For example:

mtcnn downloads its weights internally.

deepface automatically fetches FaceNet/ArcFace weights.

OpenCV ships with Haar Cascade XML files.

You donâ€™t need to manually manage these files in a models/ folder.
